        description:
          'Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding condition that affects premature infants. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina, which is the light-sensitive part of the eye. This disorder is primarily seen in infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or weighing less than 2.75 pounds at birth. ROP can lead to retinal detachment and permanent vision loss if not diagnosed and treated early. Timely screening and intervention are crucial for preventing severe outcomes, but early detection remains a challenge, particularly in areas with a shortage of trained specialists.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Breaking Down the Diagnosis Codes',
        description:
          'In diagnosing ROP, healthcare professionals use specific Diagnosis Codes (DG) to categorize the severity of the condition. These codes provide a standardized method for identifying the different stages of ROP and other retinal abnormalities. The diagnosis code system ranges from Stage 0, which signifies "No ROP," to Stage 5, which represents severe retinal detachment.',

        title: 'The Problem & How We Can Help',
        description:
          'ROP is a growing global concern, and its early detection is critical for preventing vision loss in premature infants. However, the lack of trained specialists, especially in remote or underserved areas, makes timely diagnosis difficult. RetinoPortal offers a solution to this problem by leveraging a deep learning-based model that detects and classifies ROP with high accuracy. Trained on a dataset of over 6,000 retinal images, our model provides reliable results, ensuring fast and accurate diagnosis.',
