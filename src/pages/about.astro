    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">What is Retinopathy of Prematurity?</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding condition that affects premature infants. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina, which is the light-sensitive part of the eye. This disorder is primarily seen in infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or weighing less than 2.75 pounds at birth. ROP can lead to retinal detachment and permanent vision loss if not diagnosed and treated early. Timely screening and intervention are crucial for preventing severe outcomes, but early detection remains a challenge, particularly in areas with a shortage of trained specialists.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      In our research, we explored a deep learning-based solution to automate the diagnosis and classification of ROP severity. Our model uses retinal images to detect the condition and categorize it into various stages, allowing for quicker and more accurate decision-making by healthcare professionals.

  <!-- Breaking Down the Diagnosis Codes ********************** -->

  <section class="my-10">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">Breaking Down the Diagnosis Codes</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      In diagnosing ROP, healthcare professionals use specific <strong>Diagnosis Codes (DG)</strong> to categorize the severity of the condition. These codes provide a standardized method for identifying the different stages of ROP and other retinal abnormalities. The diagnosis code system ranges from Stage 0, which signifies "No ROP," to Stage 5, which represents severe retinal detachment.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
      <li><strong>DG 0 (No ROP)</strong>: No signs of retinopathy.</li>
      <li><strong>DG 1-2 (ROP Stages 1-2)</strong>: Early stages of ROP, where abnormal blood vessels start to form, but the condition can often be treated with medical intervention.</li>
      <li><strong>DG 3-4 (ROP Stages 3-4)</strong>: More severe stages of ROP, where retinal detachment may begin to occur.</li>
      <li><strong>DG 5 (Complete Retinal Detachment)</strong>: Severe ROP that can result in blindness without immediate medical intervention.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Codes</strong>: Some codes specify other forms of ROP such as AP-ROP or post-treatment stages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-4">
      These codes are used to assess the stage of ROP and determine the appropriate treatment, ensuring timely and accurate care for premature infants.

  <!-- The Problem & How We Can Help ********************** -->

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">The Problem & How We Can Help</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      ROP is a growing global concern, and its early detection is critical for preventing vision loss in premature infants. However, the lack of trained specialists, especially in remote or underserved areas, makes timely diagnosis difficult. Traditional manual screening methods are resource-intensive, requiring skilled ophthalmologists to interpret retinal images, a process that is often delayed due to a shortage of experts.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      RetinoPortal offers a solution to this problem. Our platform leverages a deep learning-based model that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect and classify ROP with high accuracy. Trained on a dataset of over 6,000 retinal images, our model has achieved <strong>98.48% accuracy</strong> in diagnosing ROP, ensuring fast and reliable results for healthcare providers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      RetinoPortal is designed to be a tool that assists in rapidly identifying whether a premature infant has ROP, with a high degree of accuracy. Our model also provides a classification of ROP into specific stages, helping doctors decide on the most effective course of action.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      As part of our mission to improve ROP diagnosis, we encourage healthcare professionals to <strong>create an account</strong> on RetinoPortal. By doing so, you'll be able to store and track historical reports, revisit them at any time, and access more insights into your patient's condition. The <strong class="text-green-500">upload button</strong> in green allows you to easily upload retinal images for analysis.
